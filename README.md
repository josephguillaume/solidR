R package to interact with a Solid server: https://solidproject.org/

It uses the [httr2](https://github.com/r-lib/httr2/) package to implement the Solid-OIDC OAuth flow. See: 
https://solid.github.io/solid-oidc/primer/

Example:
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("josephguillaume/solidR",depend=TRUE)

library(solidR)
library(httr2)

client <- solid_client_register_dyn("https://solidcommunity.net")
request(url) %>%
 req_oauth_solid_dpop(client) %>%
 req_perform() %>%
 resp_body_string()
```

Some higher level functions are also provided:

- `rdf_parse_solid` returns parsed triples in an rdflib rdf object
